    -- OnGameLoad( Event ) :: void
    -- Register a function to be run on module load.
    -- This is called every time a save file is loaded *except* for the instance when a mod is loaded into a save file that it previously wasn't part of.
    -- Additionally this is called when connecting to any other game in a multiplayer session and should never change the game state.
    --
    -- This is meant for specific reasons:
    -- * re-register conditional event handlers
    -- * re-setup meta tables
    --
    -- Doing any other logic when loading a save file can break the replay and cause desync issues if the mod is used in multiplayer.

    -- OnGameInit( Event ) :: void
    -- Register a callback to be run on mod init.
    -- This is called once when a new save game is created or once when a save file is loaded that previously didn't contain the mod.
    -- This is always called before other event handlers and is meant for setting up initial values that a mod will use for its lifetime.
